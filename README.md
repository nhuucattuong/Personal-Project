Transformer Health and Grid Fault Detection Monitoring System Using IoT

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The system monitors key grid parameters - voltage, current, and transformer temperature and gas detection - 
and transmits sensor datas to Power BI for real-time analysis. 
When abnormal values or faults are detected, alerts are triggered automatically to ensure quick maintenance.
