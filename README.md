Transformer Health and Grid Fault Detection Monitoring System Using IoT

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The system monitors key grid parameters: voltage, current, and transformer temperature and gas detection. It then
and transmits sensor datas to Power BI (Streaming Dataset) for real-time analysis. 
When abnormal values or faults are detected, alerts are triggered automatically to ensure quick maintenance.
