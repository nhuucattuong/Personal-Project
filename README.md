PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The system monitors key grid parameters - voltage, current, and transformer temperature and gas detection - 
and transmits sensor datas to Power BI for real-time analysis. 
When abnormal values or faults are detected, alerts are triggered automatically to ensure quick maintenance.

**Key Features**
1. Real-time fault detection in grid systems
2. Continuous monitoring of transformer performance

**Tool and Technologies**
1. Hardware: Arduino/ESP8266, Sensors
2. Software: Arduino IDE
3. Power Converter Design: 3-phase AC-DC converter
4. Programming: C++

**Key Features**
1. Real-time fault detection in grid systems
2. Continuous monitoring of transformer performance
3. Improved operational efficiency and reduced downtime

**Results**
1. Improved fault response time and reduced system downtime.
2. Demonstrated stable communication between hardware and IoT platform.

**Future Enhancements**
1. Power BI Dashboard for advanced analytics and historical data tracking.
2. Multi-Transformer Support for monitoring multiple transformers in a power grid.
